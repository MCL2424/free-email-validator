1. Make sure you have node.js installed on your computer    
   1.1 If you don't have node.js installed you can download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/download
2. Download the GIT files for this project locally
3. Open the files on your code editor (I like to use VS code!) and open the terminal within your code editor.
4. Run npm init on your terminal - this will create a new file called packaged.json
5. Open packaged.json and underneath 

When all the files are downloaded, you need to make sure that node.js is already installed on your computer.
